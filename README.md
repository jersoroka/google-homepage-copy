<h1>Google Homepage Copy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>One of the final projects for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations?">Foundations in Web Development course by The Odin Project</a> is recreating the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS. I recreated the page without looking at the code and iteratively working towards replicating the design of the page.</p>

Below is a screenshot of the page:<br>
